CartoDB Subway Crime Map
================

A CartoDB map that has a mode change and buttons to show the rate and total of various crime categories in the New York City subway system.

This map uses two datasets: NYPD data on all felonies and misdemeanors in the city subway system over a roughly five-year period, from July 1, 2008 to Aug. 4, 2013 (see: raw data) and ridership data from the Metropolitian Transportation Authority.

The map can be viewed at [www.nydailynews.com/subway](http://www.nydailynews.com/subway).
